# About

This application is designed to track correlation between domain specific keywords. It could be used to correlate products based on which are frequently bought together or viewed subsequently.

You might have, for example, a product named `"red-shirt"`, who has a low affinity with `"blue-socks"`, but perhaps a high affinity with `"red-socks"`. An underlying relationship may not be obvious or intuitive, but this application is designed to capture correlation data, and offer rankings of a keyword's most correlated keywords.
